# HurricaneVis
Repo of the application HurricaneVis. 

This application was coded in the diploma thesis work of Michael Berberich, a student of the University of 
Applied Sciences Kaiserslautern, while he worked at the Mississippi State University at the HPC2.

The application used VRJuggler, vjVTK, VTK and OpenGL/GLSL. It is outdated and will be replaced by a 
immersive VTK-application in 2020 or 2021.
